In this small and simple project I will download Linux Ubuntu in VirtualBox. Installing any type of OS onto your hypervisor is great for many different things such as creating honeypots, home labs, testing new configurations, or even just testing the OS itself. Lets now begin by download Virtual box which can be done by downloading from their official site here --->Â [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)


Secondly the actual operating system must be installed which can be found here at
